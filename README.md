# Setup Fortify on Demand Uploader

Build secure software fast with [Fortify](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/solutions/application-security). This GitHub Action sets up the Fortify on Demand (FoD) Uploader to integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) into your GitHub workflows. This action:
* Downloads and caches the specified version of the Fortify on Demand Uploader JAR file
* Adds the `FOD_UPLOAD_JAR` environment variable containing the full path to the Fortify on Demand Uploader JAR file

## Usage

FoD Uploader requires source code and dependencies to be packaged into a zip file. We recommend using the Fortify ScanCentral Client to perform the packaging before invoking FoD Uploader, as illustrated in the following example workflow:

```yaml
name: FoD SAST scan                                     # Name of this workflow
on:
  push:                                                 # Perform Fortify SAST on push and/or pull requests
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:                                                  
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest                              # Use the appropriate runner for building your source code

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2                       # Check out source code
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v1                     # Set up Java 1.8; required by ScanCentral Client and FoD Uploader
        with:
          java-version: 1.8
      - uses: fortify/gha-setup-scancentral-client@v1   # Set up ScanCentral Client and add to system path
      - uses: fortify/gha-setup-fod-uploader@v1         # Set up FoD Uploader, set FOD_UPLOAD_JAR variable
      - run: scancentral package -bt mvn -o package.zip # Package source code using ScanCentral Client
                                                        # Start Fortify on Demand SAST scan:
      - run: java -jar $FOD_UPLOAD_JAR -z package.zip -aurl https://api.ams.fortify.com/ -purl https://ams.fortify.com/ -rid "$FOD_RELEASE_ID" -tc "$FOD_TENANT" -uc "$FOD_USER" "$FOD_PAT" -ep 2 -pp 1
        env:                                            
          FOD_TENANT: ${{ secrets.FOD_TENANT }}
          FOD_USER: ${{ secrets.FOD_USER }}
          FOD_PAT: ${{ secrets.FOD_PAT }}
          FOD_RELEASE_ID: ${{ secrets.FOD_RELEASE_ID }} 
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2                # Archive ScanCentral logs for debugging purposes
        if: always()
        with:
          name: scancentral-logs
          path: ~/.fortify/scancentral/log
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2                # Archive ScanCentral package for debugging purposes
        if: always()
        with:
          name: package
          path: package.zip
```

This example workflow demonstrates the use of the `fortify/gha-setup-scancentral-client` and `fortify/gha-setup-fod-uploader` actions to set up ScanCentral Client and FoD Uploader respectively, 
and then invoking these utilities in `run` instructions similar to how you would run these manually from a command line. All potentially sensitive data is stored in the GitHub secrets storage.

### Considerations

* Be sure to consider the appropriate event triggers in your workflows, based on your project and branching strategy
* The environment variables and command line arguments in the example workflow can be modified to use API Key authentication instead of a Personal Access Tokens
* .NET payloads should not be packaged with ScanCentral Client, but rather must be packaged according to the Fortify on Demand guidelines. FoD support for .NET payloads generated by ScanCentral Client is currently in development.
* Windows-based runners use different syntax and different file locations. In particular:
    * Environment variables are referenced as `$Env:var` instead of `$var`, resulting in a `run` command like the following:  
    `- run: java -jar "$Env:FOD_UPLOAD_JAR" -z package.zip -aurl https://api.ams.fortify.com/ -purl https://ams.fotify.com/ -rid "$Env:FOD_RELEASE_ID" -tc "$Env:FOD_TENANT" -uc "$Env:FOD_USER" "$Env:FOD_PAT" -ep 2 -pp 1`
    * ScanCentral logs are stored in a different location, so the upload-artifact step would need to be adjusted accordingly if you wish to archive ScanCentral logs

	Note that in combination with FoD Uploader, *only* the ScanCentral `Package` command is relevant. Other ScanCentral commands are not used in combination with FoD Uploader, and none of the other ScanCentral components like ScanCentral Controller or ScanCentral Sensor are used when submitting scans to FoD.

## Inputs

### `version`
**Required** The version of the Fortify Uploader to be set up. Default `latest`.

## Outputs

### `FOD_UPLOAD_JAR` environment variable
Specifies the location of the FoD Uploader JAR file
